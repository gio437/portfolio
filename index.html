    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="about">Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! A bit of a background about me. I have a huge passion for programming and web design. Figuring out complex problems and coming up with responsive and creative solutions is my favorite past time. I am an aspiring Junior Web Developer! My main strengths are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Below are a couple of projects I wanted to showcase, thank you for taking the time to look and enjoy your stay! </p>
    <h2>CV React Project</h2>
