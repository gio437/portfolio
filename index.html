    <h2 class="cv-title">CV React Project</h2>
    <a href = 'https://gio437.github.io/cv-project-react/'> <img class = 'cv' src= 'cv.png'> </a>
    <p class="cv-text">My first React project! This was a interesting experience. Learning a framework like React is very eye opening. Concepts like JSX and useState were very foreign concepts at the time. Its a solid departure from vanilla JavaScript. Click <a href = 'https://gio437.github.io/cv-project-react/'>here</a> or the image above to check the project out. Link to the code <a href='https://github.com/gio437/cv-project-react'>here.</a></p>

    <h2>Battleship Project</h2>
    <a href = 'https://gio437.github.io/battleship/'> <img class = 'battleship' src= 'battleship.png'> </a>
    <p class="ship-text">The classic battleship game. This project was fairly complicated and took some time and effort. But the result payed off. One of my first projects where I dived deep into test driven development. Click <a href='https://gio437.github.io/battleship/'>here</a> or the image above to check the project out. Link to the code <a href='https://github.com/gio437/battleship'>here.</a></p>
    <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
    <a href = 'https://gio437.github.io/tic-tac-toe/'> <img class = 'tic' src= 'tic.png'> </a>
    <p class = 'tic-text'>This game was a fun project to do. It was my first time experimenting with new JavaScript function syntax such as Factory Functions and the Module Pattern. I am very happy with the result. Click <a href='https://gio437.github.io/tic-tac-toe/'>here</a> or the image above to check the project out. Link to the code <a href='https://github.com/gio437/tic-tac-toe'>here.</a></p>
    <h2>Weather App</h2>
    <a href='https://gio437.github.io/weather-app/'> <img class='weather' src='weather.png'></a>
    <p class="weather-text">This is a simple weather app project. It was my first attempt at using API's. The design is inspired by the layout used my the iPhone weather app. It truly opened my eyes to power and capability's of API's. Click <a href="https://gio437.github.io/weather-app/">here</a> or the image above to check the project out. Link to the code <a href='https://github.com/gio437/weather-app'>here.</a></p>
